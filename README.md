# HOWMUNCH

## Introduction

**HOWMUNCH** is a Django-based web application designed to help users calculate the calories burned from various exercises needed to offset the calorie intake from different foods. As a personal trainer and fitness coach, I developed this project to bridge the gap between food consumption and exercise, providing a practical tool for fitness enthusiasts and everyday users to make informed decisions about their diet and exercise routines.

**Deployed Site:** [HOWMUNCH Live](https://your-deployed-site-url.com)

**Final Project Blog Article:** [HowMunch: Calorie Counting App](https://medium.com/@michaeldmwai/howmunch-calorie-counting-app-a23085bbaa2d)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MichaelMwai/how_munch.git
   cd howmunch
   ```
````

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the homepage of the application.
2. Enter the name of a food item to get its nutritional information.
3. View the total calorie count and suggested exercises to burn off those calories.
4. Use the charts and alerts to get additional insights into nutritional content.

## Challenges

- **Unforeseen Technical Challenges:** The API Ninjas made 'calories' and 'protein' premium features, making it impossible to calculate these values. We are considering switching to an alternative API or integrating additional resources in the future.
- **Adaptation:** We adapted by focusing on available features and providing detailed nutritional information within the constraints.
- **Unexpected Non-Technical Challenges:** Ensuring the accuracy and relevance of nutritional information due to frequent API changes.

## Collaboration

While I worked on this project independently, I received valuable feedback from peers and mentors, particularly in refining the user interface and improving API integration. Collaboration with fellow developers and fitness experts has helped enhance the project’s effectiveness and usability.

## Project Updates

- **API Changes:** We are exploring alternative APIs to replace the premium features previously offered by API Ninjas.
- **Feature Enhancements:** Additional features, such as user accounts and personalized exercise recommendations, are planned for future updates.

## Progress

On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate my progress this week as an 8. Progress is measured by completing key features and integrating feedback. The project is on track to meet the proposed deadline, with some minor adjustments planned based on the latest feedback and technical challenges.
